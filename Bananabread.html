            <h1>Banana Bread</h1>
            <img src="./images/Bananabread.jpg" width="300" height="400">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is my favorite banana bread recipe, one that I've cherished for years. It's one of those classic recipes that you start to know by heart, just like a good pie crust or chocolate chip cookies recipe. This bread comes to mind first when I have leftover spotty bananas on the counter, and it's the bread that's on constant rotation in my freezer stash.</p>
            <p2>The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork to whisk the eggs, and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. The sugar amount is flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, including me, do just fine with 3/4 cup, and many are happy with 1/2 cup.</p2>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups All Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp. Baking Soda</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. Salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. Ground Cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Unsalted Butter(Room Temperature)</li>
                <li>3/4 cup Brown Sugar</li>
                <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
                <li>1/3 cup Plain Yogurt or Sour Cream</li>
                <li>2 cups Mashed bananas</li>
                <li>1 tsp. Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Lowering the oven rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a metal 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until combined.
                </li>
                <li>With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts, if using.
                </li>
                <li>Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be after 60–65 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking every 5 minutes around the 60-minute mark.
                </li>
                <li>Remove bread from the oven and allow the bread to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for 1 hour. Remove bread from the pan and cool bread directly on the wire rack until ready to slice and serve.
                </li>
                <li>Cover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together.</li>
